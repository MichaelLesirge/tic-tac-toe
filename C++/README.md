# C++ Console Tic-Tac-Toe Game

Simply Tic-Tac-Toe game with C++. Nothing to intresting was added since I am still pretty new to C++. The code is probbly not the best it could be since I still need to learn how to use all the standard libary stuff better.

## Speical features
- Use words like top/middle/buttom and left/middle/right instead of just row column numbers
