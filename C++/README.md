# C++ Console Tic-Tac-Toe Game
Simply Tic-Tac-Toe game with C++. Nothing to intreating was added since I am still pretty new to C++. The code is probably not the best it could be since I still need to learn how to use all the standard library stuff better.

## Special features
- Use words like top/middle/button and left/middle/right instead of just row column numbers

## Why I learned C++
I'm not really sure why I learned C++. I was told it was a good language to learn since it would make all other languages easer to learn and so I decided to learn it as my second proggraming language after Python
