# TI-Basic Tic-Tac-Toe Game

Simple Tic-Tac-Toe game with TI-Basic. Meant to run on a TI84 graphing calculator. Very quick and dirty game, and was constrained by features of the programming environment (No arrays, max of 10 strings, etc).

## Special features
- Runs on TI-84 Graphing Calculator
- Uses numpad of calculator as position selection

## Demo



## Why I learned TI-Basic
I got a TI-84 graphing calculator as instructed for math class, and decided I would try the programming thing on it, just for fun.
