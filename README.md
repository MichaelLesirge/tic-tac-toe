# Tic-tac-toe in all the programming languages I learn.
Every time I learn a new programming langauge well enough I try to create a version of tic-tac-toe with it. Every time I try and do it slightly differently. 

## How to play games without download
[Run Python game](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/online-compiler/) (tic-tac-toe.py).  
[Run C++ game](https://www.programiz.com/cpp-programming/online-compiler/) (tic-tac-toe.cpp).  
Just copy and paste it into the main file and hit run.  
  
[Open HTML, CSS, JavaScrip game](https://raw.githack.com/michael-lesirge/tic-tac-toe/main/HTML-CSS-JS/index.html).

## Plans

This directory kind of empty currently but I am tring to learn C++. I also want to learn Java, C#, and Go at some point.
