# Tic-tac-toe in all the programming languages I learn.
Every time I am trying to learn a new programming language I try to create an overcomplicated version of tic-tac-toe using the base version of the language. Every time I try to do it slightly differently. **Understand that I made these when I was very new to the languages so the code is not the cleanest**, and definitely does not follow best practices. The goal was to get them done to learn the basics fast.

## Demos and special features
Video demos of each game running, and a list of special features that make it more interesting and technically complex then the basic 3x3 tic-tac-toe. Decided to do video demos since I have a feeling attempting to run all of these would be a massive pain as I spent no time trying to create easy build systems or anything like that.

### Python
- Optional custom board creation and win condition
- Custom player creation
- Win count tracker
- Colors and nice ASCII art board
- Object oriented design
- Adaptive AI player trained on many games on specific game configuration
- Player input verification

### Java
- Optional custom board creation and win condition
- Optional custom number of players
- Win count tracker
- Colors and nice ASCII art board with screen clearing
- Flexible object oriented design
- Player input verification

### C++
- Use words like top/middle/button and left/middle/right instead of just row column numbers, with player input verification
- Attempted usage of good C++ practices (using const, some usage of standard library)
- Silly usage of some advanced features like templates and fold expressions to try them out (used in custom Python like print function)

### TI-Basic
- Runs on TI-84 Graphing Calculator
- Uses numpad of calculator as position selection
- Optimised to only redraw needed chars to prevent extra screen refreshes
- Player input verification

### Dart
- Custom board creation
- Simple custom player creation, probably smoothest experience
- Nice ASCII art board without extra clutter and screen clearing
- Choose where you want to go on X, Y grid, with player input verification

### HTML-CSS-JS
- Only one with GUI, runs on web
- Custom board creation and custom win condition
- Highlight winning pieces after game ends
- Plain HTML, CSS, and JS with no frameworks on libraries, tried to get a good understanding of basics. DOM manipulation only.

## Plans
I probably won't make any new ones of these for a while so I can get better at the stuff I sort of know, but when I do feel like learning a new language it will probably either be TypeScript, Go, C#, or maybe even Rust.
