## Tic-tac-toe in all the programming languages I learn.

### How to run
You can run my python tic-tac-toe (tic-tac-toe.py) [here](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/online-compiler/) on this online python interpreter and my C++ game here [here](https://www.programiz.com/cpp-programming/online-compiler/). Just copy and paste it into the main file and hit run.

This directory kind of empty currently but I am tring to learn C++. I also want to learn Java and C# at some point.
