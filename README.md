# Tic-tac-toe in all the programming languages I learn.
Every time I learn a new programming langauge well enough I try to create a version of tic-tac-toe with it. Every time I try and do it slightly differently. 

## How to play games without download
[Open Web Game (HTML, CSS, JavaScrip)](https://raw.githack.com/michael-lesirge/tic-tac-toe/main/HTML-CSS-JS/index.html).

[Run Python game](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/online-compiler/) (tic-tac-toe.py).  
[Run C++ game](https://www.programiz.com/cpp-programming/online-compiler/) (tic-tac-toe.cpp).  
Just copy and paste it into the main file and hit run. This only works with easly with the 1 file games.

## Plans

I probbly wont make any new ones of these for a while so I can get better at the stuff I sort of know but when I do feel like learning a new langage it will probbly either be TypeScript, Go, C#, or maybe even Rust.
