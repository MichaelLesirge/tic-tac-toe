# Tic-tac-toe in all the programming languages I learn.
Every time I learn a new programming language well enough I try to create a overcomplicated version of tic-tac-toe using it. Every time I try and do it slightly differently. 

## Plans
I probably won't make any new ones of these for a while so I can get better at the stuff I sort of know but when I do feel like learning a new language it will probably either be TypeScript, Go, C#, or maybe even Rust.
