## Tic-tac-toe in all the programming languages I learn.

### How to run
You can run my python tic-tac-toe (tic-tac-toe.py) [here on this online python interpreter](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/online-compiler/) and my C++ game (tic-tac-toe.cpp) [here](https://www.programiz.com/cpp-programming/online-compiler/). Just copy and paste it into the main file and hit run.

You can open my HTML, CSS, JavaScrip project [here](https://rawcdn.githack.com/michael-lesirge/tic-tac-toe/6331b8d28bd63cb61284b3c0f8897683a306da28/HTML-CSS-JS/index.html).

This directory kind of empty currently but I am tring to learn C++. I also want to learn Java and C# at some point.
