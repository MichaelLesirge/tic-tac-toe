# HTML-CSS-JS Web Tic-Tac-Toe Game
Simple web tic-tac-toe with only HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript. I thought before I use any JS libraries I would get comfortable with the base language first.

## Why I learned HTML, CSS, and JS
I wanted to be able to create a website. I naturally learned it since I needed to make a frontend for my Python Django thing
