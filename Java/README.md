# Java Tic-Tac-Toe Game
The goal of this project was to learn the most about Java as I could in one project so I made it meaninglessly overcomplicated just for the sake of it.

## Special Features
- Custom board creation
- Colors and nice ASCII art board

## Why I learned Java
Learned it for robotics and because I wanted to make Minecraft Mod
